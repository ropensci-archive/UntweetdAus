# UntweetdAus
Tweeting the untweetable threatened species

This is a project from RopenSci ozunconference 2018. See issues for the problems we encountered.

Idea was originally discussed here: https://github.com/ropensci/ozunconf18/issues/13
and comes about via this paper: [Tweeting for their lives: Visibility of threatened species on twitter](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1617138118301183?dgcid=coauthor)
